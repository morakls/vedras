It is really hard to predict the start of big gatherings and coffee parties that are close to the summer we are used to. Despite the temporary pause of the entire event industry, Vedras does not want to stand aside and wait for this pandemic to end on its own, but as we always do, we are embarking on new ventures and victories.

We present something that will help us combat this pandemic and make everyone return to normal as soon as possible.",
